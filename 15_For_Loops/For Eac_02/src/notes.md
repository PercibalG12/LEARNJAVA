# For-Each Loop
There is also a `"for-each"` loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array:

#### Syntax
```java
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
// code block to be executed
}
```

> The following example outputs all elements in the cars array, using a "for-each" loop:

#### Example
```java
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
for (String i : cars) {
System.out.println(i);
}
```
